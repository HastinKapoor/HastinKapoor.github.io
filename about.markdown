Hi! I'm Hastin Kapoor, a first year PhD student at the University of Utah working under Vijay Nagarajan. <br>

I specialize in compound memory models and cache coherence. <br>

I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, with a focus on Math.
My undergraduate thesis is titled "A Study of Gr√∂bner Bases and their Application in the Verification
of Galois Field Arithmetic Circuits" and can be found [here](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/0e02f02d-9cff-4ba0-a8fe-5ac13d9e288e/content). <br>

Feel free to explore my portfolio, check out some of my recent work, or message me at u1528432@utah.edu. <br>
